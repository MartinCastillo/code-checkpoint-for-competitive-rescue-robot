When this program is closed in an unprogrammed manner, it is opened again, but first it saves a variable in the stat.txt file that belongs to the same directory, this variable indicates in which part of the code was left the execution before it was closed. If e.g. the raspberry pi shuts down unexpectedly, the program starts from where it left off (You should set the code to run with the raspberry boot).
